<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My goal in creating this application is to provide an easy way to track tasks exclusibly for the individual users work-day. This application allows users to not only track their schedule on a hourly basis but to also maintain a healthy work life by visually assessing the amount of hour remaining in their work day and completing tasking within that frame without tapping into their personal time.  

### Built With
